# Grab a Prompt

A library of ready-made AI prompt templates for writers and everyone working with texts, right inside Obsidian (covers literary fiction, genre fiction, non-fiction, copywriting, content marketing, etc.). Pick a template for researching, summarizing, editing, proofing, or brainstorming — it auto-fills with your document or selection and copies to clipboard, ready to paste into ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any LLM.
